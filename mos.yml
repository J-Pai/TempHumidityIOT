# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"24
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

config_schema:
  - ["app.dht.fahrenheit", "b", true, {title: "Use Fahrenheit"}]
  - ["app.dht.humidity_offset", "i", 5, {title: "Constant offset for humidity"}]
  - ["wifi.sta.ip", "s", "192.168.0.82", {title: "Static IP address"}]
  - ["wifi.sta.netmask", "s", "255.255.255.0", {title: "Static netmask"}]

cdefs:
  # GPIO pin that DHT is connected to.
  DHT_PIN: 5
  # Number of data points to save.
  DHT_HISTORY_MAX_SIZE: 24
  # Amount of time between storing of each historical data point (milliseconds).
  # 15 minutes = 900000 ms
  DHT_HISTORY_PERIOD: 3600000
  # GPIO pin that the switch is attached to.
  LED_ENABLE_PIN: 4

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
